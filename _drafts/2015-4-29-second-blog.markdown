This is an English blog wrote by a Chinese.

I concerned about write blog in English. Now I very want to share something. And I decided to use English blog just now. Because I thought it like programming if you want to share with more people, then you have to use common languages those most people used.

My English always not so good. But I never avoid to use it. The best way to improve it is using it.

If I shared something you feel useful, you could comment here or in codes, even to create pull request on Github to fix my language mistake to support me. Thank you. The repository is public, here is: https://github.com/emj365/my-blog
