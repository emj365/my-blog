This's a blog deploy on [Github Pages][github pages] which is develop by [Jekyll][jekyll].

For developers [Jekyll][jekyll] is a good choose as simple blog system. It's good engouh and simple to use. I'm so happy that I could write blog use [Markdown][markdown] and [Textile][textile].

Should thanks [Github Pages][github pages] provide a free deploy space. It's so good I can tracking codes of blog and publish blog entries in same time.

[Disqus][disqus] are cool stuffs which is a good comment system. It's very easy to add into website.

I'll keep write blog use English. My English is not good engouh, but I'll try and I should practice this.
